## PRICING: What should be price for the item ?
A game company gave gift coins to its users for purchasing items in a game.Using these virtual coins, users buy various items for their characters.The game company did not specify a price for an item and provided users to buy this item at the price they wanted.For example, for the item named shield, users will buy this shield by paying the amounts they see fit.A user can pay with 30 units of virtual money given to his/her, while the other user can pay with 45 units. Therefore, users can buy this item with the amounts they can afford to pay.

## Problems to be solved:
1. Does the price of the item differ by category? Express it statistically.
1. Depending on the first question, what should the item cost? Explain why?
1. It is desirable to be "flexible" in terms of price. Create a decision support system for the price strategy.
1. Simulate item purchases and income for possible price changes.


## SUMMARY

- A statistical test was applied to see if prices varied categorically.
   - the assumptions for the test were checked
   - All Categories rejected the normal distribution hypothesis, so it was decided to apply  non-parametric independent two sample test.
- It was observed whether there was a significant statistical difference between the categories and pricing has been made for the item.
- Confidence interval was determined as flexibility was desired in terms of price.
- Product purchases were simulated for possible price changes according to the confidence interval.
